# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## ML Model
The Model was created in Google Colab, a collaboratory environment where individuals can collaborate together, and uploaded to Google Drive. Running the script in that environment allows you to run a remote, cloud-hosted environment by Google. 

To run the script in Google Drive, create a folder called "Muvision" that contains two folders, "datasets" and "models". The "models" folder is used to store the models that will be created by the script. 

### Dataset
The dataset that we used for this project is found here: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sagyamthapa/handwritten-math-symbols](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sagyamthapa/handwritten-math-symbols). Initially we used this dataset: [https://github.com/ThomasLech/CROHME_extractor](https://github.com/ThomasLech/CROHME_extractor) but we found that the letters were too skeletonized and thus leading to inaccurate results.

Inside the "datasets" folder in the Google Drive project, upload the dataset used (link above) and put it in a folder called "handwritten_math_symbols".
